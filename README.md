# MediBot-AI-Medical-Chatbot-RAG-
A smart medical chatbot built fully on open-source tooling with a simple Streamlit UI. It uses HuggingFace for embeddings, FAISS (CPU) for vector storage, and either Mistral (HuggingFace Inference) or a fast, free Groq-hosted Llama model for the conversational LLM. The retrieval pipeline follows a classic RAG pattern.
